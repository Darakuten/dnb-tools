For omics data, on the other hand, it is useful to calculate statistical indexes by calculation over multiple-samples rather over time [1,4]. This software provides tools for such calculation of statistical indexes from omics data of multiple samples.\n","\n"," There are two important indexes to characterize DNB: one for strength of fluctuations in each variable of DNB and the other for correlations of fluctuations between each pair of variables in DNB. You can choose mad(median absolute deviation) or std(standard deviation) for the former, and sperman (Sperman’s correlation coefficients) or pearson (Pearson's correlation coefficients) for the latter by your own choice. There is a report to show that the median absolute deviation and Sperman’s correlation coefficients are more appropriate when data include outliers [5], although decision of outliers is a difficult problem by itself.\n","\n","\n","## References\n","\n","1.
